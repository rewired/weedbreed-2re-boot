# Intent: Set Light Schedule UX

**ID:** 0035
**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** unassigned
**Priority:** P1
**Tags:** frontend, intents, ui, track-5

## Rationale
One exemplar intent is adjusting a zone's light schedule. Building a dedicated form with optimistic UX gated on ack success demonstrates the end-to-end intent flow and validates the error dictionary.

## Scope
- In: implement form component under `packages/ui/src/components/intents/SetLightScheduleForm.tsx` with validation aligned to SEC light schedule rules.
- In: integrate with intent client to submit payloads, show loading state, and surface toast/error copy from dictionary.
- Out: backend logic (already handled) or other intents.

## Deliverables
- Form component + hook, unit tests at `packages/ui/src/components/intents/__tests__/SetLightScheduleForm.test.tsx` covering validation and ack handling.
- Storybook (or local preview) entry documenting states (loading, success, error) under `packages/ui/src/stories/intents/SetLightScheduleForm.stories.tsx`.
- Copy updates in `packages/ui/src/intl/en.json` (or similar) for button text and error strings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Form validates photoperiod hours sum to 24 and disables submit until valid.
- On submit, spinner shows until ack resolves; success triggers optimistic UI update via store action.
- Errors map to dictionary entries and show toast plus inline message.
- Tests cover happy path, validation error, and transport error mapping.
